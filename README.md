# CLion_SFML_HelloWorld

This is my CLion Project File containing a functional SFML 'Hello World' Program. I decided to upload this after having to suffer through one and a half weeks of frustration, answer pages, documentation, etc. (in other words: the sacred software debugging ritual for when you have no idea what is wrong with the code ;) ).

It includes the FindSFML.cmake script, the edited CMakeLists.txt file, and a basic Hello World program (which displays the green circle in a window). Hopefully this will aid others in getting started with SFML. Enjoy!
